What is GENESIS?
================
GENESIS (GENeralized-Ensemble SImulation System) is a suite of 
computer programs for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations 
of biomolecular systems. 

GENESIS is free software, distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 3 or later. You can freely redistribute it and/or
modify it as a derived work under the terms of LGPL v3 or later. 
If possible, however, it would be greatly appreciated if you send us
feedbacks. Your cooperation helps us to keep developing and managing
this official GENESIS, providing all other GENESIS users qualified
codes.
